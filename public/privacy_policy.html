    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 18, 2026</p>

    <div class="container">
        "nQws" is a product of <strong>Effedue Studio</strong>. We believe in privacy by design.
    </div>

    <p>
        Effedue Studio ("we," "our," or "us") operates the nQws mobile application (the "Service"). This page
        informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our
        Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>

    <h3>Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
        We are committed to user privacy. <strong>We do not require you to create an account, sign up, or provide any
            personally identifiable information</strong> (such as your name, email address, or phone number) to use the
        Service.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <p>
        When you access the Service, standard usage logs may be generated by our server infrastructure. This may include
        your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, device type, and the time and date of your requests. This data is
        used solely for diagnostic and security purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
        To provide a seamless experience, nQws stores specific data locally on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Settings such as theme choice (Light/Dark), font size, and language
            preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Read History:</strong> A local list of articles you have opened, used to visually indicate which
            news items you have already read.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data resides solely on your device and is not synchronized to any external server by us.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
    <p>
        Effedue Studio uses the collected data for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Service.</li>
        <li>To monitor usage and detect technical issues.</li>
        <li>To improve the performance and user experience of the application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We may employ third-party companies to facilitate our Service. These third parties have access to your personal
        data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other
        purpose.
    </p>

    <h3>Cloudflare</h3>
    <p>
        We use Cloudflare to host our API endpoints. Cloudflare acts as a security and performance layer. By using the
        app, your requests pass through Cloudflare's network.
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Privacy Policy</a>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Local Data:</strong> Data preferences and history stored on your device are retained until you manually
        clear the app data or uninstall the application.
        <br>
        <strong>Server Logs:</strong> Usage data collected by our infrastructure providers is retained for a limited
        period as per their standard security and logging policies.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
        The security of your data is important to us. We use commercially reasonable means to protect your data, but
        please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect personal data associated with a user account, you act as the controller of your local
        data. You can exercise your rights by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access & Deletion:</strong> You can view and delete your locally stored data at any time by clearing
            the application's storage in your device settings or by uninstalling the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by
            uninstalling the Application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
        with personal data, please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
